# Study Impact

A gaming application to make studying more fun for students. This game can help quiz students on various subjects through a fantasy-like setting . By doing quizzes, they are able to unlock characters and accessories. They can gain points by collecting more land. The more points you have received, the higher the rank. You can play with your friends and battle for the highest rank.  


# Design Process

Our website is for students who are struggling with studies and motivation to study. We want to achieve a more engaging and enjoyable learning experience for the users to have more motivation to study. The fantasy trope genre is one of the most popular themes of gaming in the industry now, thus we are using that theme to encourage students to study in a more enjoyable way which will be able to help them to see that studying can be fun. 
# User case study:
- Mary loves to play Genshin Impact, she plays it often to the point that her grades are not good. This application can help her to study as she likes fantasy genre games. 
- John doesnâ€™t like to study because he cannot focus on wordy textbooks. This game can help to content the information and give the main points, and quiz John after learning - so that he can be able to understand and apply in the game
