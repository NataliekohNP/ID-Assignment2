# Study Impact

A gaming application to make studying more fun for students. This game can help quiz students on various subjects through a fantasy-like setting . By doing quizzes, they are able to unlock characters and accessories. They can gain points by collecting more land. The more points you have received, the higher the rank. You can play with your friends and battle for the highest rank.  


# Design Process

Our website is for students who are struggling with studies and motivation to study. We want to achieve a more engaging and enjoyable learning experience for the users to have more motivation to study. The fantasy trope genre is one of the most popular themes of gaming in the industry now, thus we are using that theme to encourage students to study in a more enjoyable way which will be able to help them to see that studying can be fun. 
# User case study:
Mary loves to play Genshin Impact, she plays it often to the point that her grades are not good. This application can help her to study as she likes fantasy genre games. 
John doesnâ€™t like to study because he cannot focus on wordy textbooks. This game can help to content the information and give the main points, and quiz John after learning so that he can be able to understand and apply in the game
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

# Features Left to Implement
# Another feature idea
# Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
1) JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

# Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:

Go to the "Contact Us" page

Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears

Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears

Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
